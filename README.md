# 🧭 Path Visualizer

A simple and interactive tool to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms.

## 🚀 Features
- Visualizes BFS, DFS, Dijkstra and A* algorithms
- Grid-based UI
- Draw walls/obstacles
- Set start and end nodes
- Step-by-step animations for algorithm flow

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React.js
- JavaScript
- CSS

## ▶️ Run Locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/path-visualizer.git
cd path-visualizer
npm install
npm start

## 📌 About the Project
This tool helps users understand how pathfinding algorithms explore and find the shortest path on a grid.

## ⭐ Algorithms
- BFS (Shortest path - unweighted)
- DFS (Fast but not always shortest)
- Dijkstra (Shortest path - weighted)
- A* (Fastest and smart using heuristic)
